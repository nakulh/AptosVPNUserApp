## Building

The code in this repository can be built in Visual Studio 2019 by opening the .sln and pressing build. However, it requires [`tunnel.dll` and `wireguard.dll`](../README.md).
You can install DLL files by following the tutorial in https://nakulhavelia.gitbook.io/aptos-vpn-decentralized-freedom/installation/vpn-user-node
